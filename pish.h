/*
 * Each input command will be parsed into this struct.
 * E.g. 
 *   If input is "du -h -d 1", we will have
 *      argc    = 4
 *      argv[0] = "du"
 *      argv[1] = "-h"
 *      argv[2] = "-d"
 *      argv[3] = "1"
 *      argv[4] = NULL
 *   It is IMPORTANT that the array is terminated by a NULL element.
 * This is different from the strings being NULL-terminated. If there
 * are 4 elements as in the example above, then argv[0] thru argv[3]
 * should contain the individual arguments, but argv[4] should be NULL.
 * This makes it easy to use argv to call `execvp()`.
